# Pathfinder Visualization
The Pathfinder Visualization is created using Java. The application shows user the shortest route to their desired destination. It uses the Djikstra Algorithm and the A* Search Algorithm. It also provides extra features for the user as in, the user is able to make 'walls' or grid blocks that prevents the algorithm from passing through or searching that block. 

The algorithms used in the pathfinder, are similiar to algorithms thats are used for maze-generations.
